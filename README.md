# MovE
MovE is a movie recommendation app developed for MLH rookie hacks hackathon.

This repo contains the backend of the application.
The backend of the app deals with the user authentication and authorisation.
It further deals with the consumption of the movie database (tmDB) API
for providing the movie list along with the necessary stats associated with it.
